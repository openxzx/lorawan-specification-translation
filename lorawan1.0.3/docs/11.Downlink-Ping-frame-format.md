# Downlink Ping frame format (Class B option)

## 11.1 Physical frame format(物理帧格式)

    A downlink Ping uses the same format as a Class A downlink frame
    but might follow a different channel frequency or data rate plan.

## 11.2 Unicast & Multicast MAC messages

    Messages can be “unicast” or “multicast”. Unicast messages are sent to a single end-device
    and multicast messages are sent to multiple end-devices. All devices of a multicast group
    MUST share the same multicast address and associated encryption keys. The LoRaWAN
    Class B specification does not specify means to remotely setup such a multicast group or
    securely distribute the required multicast key material. This must either be performed during
    the node personalization or through the application layer.

    Example: The document [RPD1] describes a possible application layer
    mechanism for over-the-air multicast key distribution.

### 11.2.1 Unicast MAC message format

    The MAC payload of a unicast downlink Ping uses the format defined in the Class A
    specification. It is processed by the end-device in exactly the same way. The same frame
    counter is used and incremented whether the downlink uses a Class B ping slot or a Class A
    downlink slot.

### 11.2.2 Multicast MAC message format

    The Multicast frames share most of the unicast frame format with a few exceptions:

    (1) They are not allowed to carry MAC commands, neither in the FOpt field, nor in the
    payload on port 0 because a multicast downlink does not have the same authentication
    robustness as a unicast frame.

    (2) The ACK and ADRACKReq bits MUST be zero. The MType field MUST carry the
    value for Unconfirmed Data Down.

    (3) The FPending bit indicates there is more multicast data to be sent. If it is set the next
    multicast receive slot will carry a data frame. If it is not set the next slot may or may
    not carry data. This bit can be used by end-devices to evaluate priorities for conflicting
    reception slots.
