# Class B Downlink slot timing

## 13.1 Definitions

    To operate successfully in Class B the end-device MUST open reception slots at precise
    instants relative to the infrastructure beacon. This section defines the required timing.
    要在B类中成功运行，终端设备必须在相对于基础设施信标的精确时刻打开接收插槽。
    本节定义了所需的时间。

    The interval between the start of two successive beacons is called the beacon period. The
    beacon frame transmission is aligned with the beginning of the BEACON_RESERVED
    interval. Each beacon is preceded by a guard time interval where no ping slot can be placed.
    The length of the guard interval corresponds to the time on air of the longest allowed frame.
    This is to insure that a Class B downlink initiated during a ping slot just before the guard time
    will always have time to complete without colliding with the beacon transmission. The usable
    time interval for ping slot therefore spans from the end of the beacon reserved time interval to
    the beginning of the next beacon guard interval.
